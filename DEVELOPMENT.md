Commands
------------

Bot commands are in the folder `commands` separated in different files. A command file has the following structure:
```js

Settings.addPermissions(['permission1', 'permission2', 'permission3']); //Add command permission for 'can' method (optional)

exports.commands = {
	altcommand1: 'command1', //commands can be references to other commands
	command1: function (arg, by, room, cmd) { //command are functions
		//do stuff
	},
	
	command2: function (arg, by, room, cmd) {
		//do stuff
	}
};
```

Commands have 4 arguments:
 - **arg**: Command argument when you use for example `command [argument]`
 - **by**: User who executed the command
 - **room**: Room where the command has been executed
 - **cmd**: Original command before refrerences. For example if you use `altcommand1`, cmd is `altcommand1` but the function correspond to `command1`

Also, command have a context:
 - `this.arg` - Argument
 - `this.by` - Argument
 - `this.room` - Argument
 - `this.cmd` - Argument
 - `this.handler` - Command function name
 - `this.cmdToken` - Command character used. Example: `.say hi` means this.cmdToken = `.`
 - `this.roomType` - Can be 'chat', 'battle' or 'pm'
 - `this.botName` - Bot username
 - `this.reply (text)` - Replies in the same room (chat or pm)
 - `this.pmReply (text)` - Replies by pm
 - `this.restrictReply (text, permission)` - Replies by chat if user has permission, by pm otherwise
 - `this.say (room, text)` - Say something to other room
 - `this.isRanked (rank)` - True if ranked equal or above, false if not
 - `this.isRoomRanked (room, rank)` - True if ranked equal or above (in specified room), false if not
 - `this.botRanked (rank)` - True if the bot has this rank or above, false if not
 - `this.isExcepted` - True if the user is excepted, false if not
 - `this.can (permission)` - True if user has permission, false if not
 - `this.canSet (permission, rank)` - Checks if the user has permission to use `set` command
 - `this.hasRank (user, rank, room)` - Similar to `isRoomRanked` but more general
 - `this.getRoom (room)` - Get a room object or null (if the bot is not in that room)
 - `this.getRoomUsers (room)` - Get an array of users who are in a room or null (if the bot is not in that room)
 - `this.getUser (user, room)` - Get an user object or null (if the user or the bot are not in that room)
 - `this.language` - Current room language
 - `this.trad (textId)` - Returns a text from the corresponding languages file
 - `this.splitReply (text)` - Returns an array with tour reply splitted in multiple messages with a max of 300 characters
 - `this.parse (cmd)` - Parse a message (to call other commands)

Features
------------

Bot features are complex modules hat fulfill secondary functions, located in the folder `features`. Each feature is a folder that must have an `index.js` main file. That file will be required of bot start and should have the following minimum structure:
```js
exports.id = 'featureid';
exports.desc = 'Simple Feature description';

exports.init = function () {
	//init function
};

exports.parse = function (room, message, isIntro, spl) {
	//data parse
};
```

Features must have a **unique id** and two essential functions:

 - **init** - Is called on connection to server, to delete residual data or start/restart feature timeouts.
 - **parse** - It will receive all server messages, already separated in lines, each parse call is a new line received.

Keeping your bot updated
------------

If you know all about [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Getting-Started) you don't need to read this. This is just for people who want to make changes in their bots, but still want to keep them updated regarding this repo.

First, fork this repo. You can do it with the button `Fork`

Second, clone your repo in your computer, you can do it with GitHub desktop Client for [Windows](https://windows.github.com/) or [Mac](https://mac.github.com/) or with a shell console:
```
$ git clone <your own fork> <My-Bot-Example-Folder>
```

Third, create a remote to get the updates (first use `cd` to reach the directory of your bot):
```
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/Ecuacion/Pokemon-Showdown-Node-Bot.git
```

Now, you can make changes, and commit them.

When you want to update, you can follow these steps:
 - Open a shell console and use `cd` to reach the directory of your bot
 - If you have uncommited changes use `git add --all` and `git commit -m "Your commit message"`
 - Use `git fetch upstream` to update your base version of Pokemon-Showdown-Node-Bot
 - Use `git checkout master` an then `git merge remotes/upstream/master`
 - If you get conflicts, solve them and use `git commit -a`
 - Once merged, your bot is updated
