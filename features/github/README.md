GitHub feature
====================

This feature is an adaptation of [https://github.com/xfix/PSDevBot](https://github.com/xfix/PSDevBot), by [xfix](https://github.com/xfix/).

**Description:** It creates a WebHook server. When it receives some data from github, it sends an `!htmlbox` to a development room. It's like a notification system.

**WARNING:** This feature requires `githubhook` to work, an optional dependency, use `npm install githubhook` to install it.

**Configuration:**

 - **room:** Choose the room to send the `!htmlbox` reports from github.
 - **secret:** Like a password, to prevent other sites from sending arbitrary data.
 - **port:** Port for listening, default is 3420

```js
exports.github = {
	room: 'development',
	secret: "",
	port: 3420
};
```

**Creating a WebHook**

This feature requires:
 - A domain for your bot. If you don't have one you can port forward using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) for example.
 - Al least one Webhooks from a remote repository. To create one go to the repositories you want to monitor, access settings panel, pick "Webhooks & Services" and select "Add webhook". Set payload URL to `http://yourdomain:3420/github/callback`, content type to `application/json`, the same secret you choose in the config and select events to send (now this only supports `push` and `pull-request` events).
